Hey, thank you stopping by! Well, being here means that you are either familiar with the discipline of Digital Forensics & Incident Reponse (DFIR) or you are interested in beginning to explore DFIR tools and techniques. The common denominator, no matter what your sense is around DFIR, is that you are using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and the wider Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Defender environments. I hope you will enjoy the following resources which come from my notes and relevant research and testing I have done. Do you have any other resources that fit here? Drop me a line at any of my mediums [here](https://www.michalos.net/about/) or pull the repo and push your request to review it.

If you find this repo useful, don't forget to ⭐ it!

### Mitigate threats using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

What better way to begin the resource list other than Microsoft Learn itself? MDE supports a lot of functionalities including artifact collection, containment, live response, advanced hunting and others which help analysts and investigators unfold alerts and incidents.

### Remote collection of Windows Forensic Artifacts using KAPE and MDE

KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor) is a powerful DFIR tool by Eric Zimmerman that primarily collects and processes collected files. [@DFIRanjith](https://twitter.com/DFIRanjith) and [Krzysztof Miodoński](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krzysztof-miodonski/) have built and published guides on how to deploy KAPE through MDE live response and collect forensic artefacts.

### Ginsu A tool for repackaging large collections to traverse Windows Defender Live Response

This script uses 7zip (7za.exe) to compress a specified folder and then splits the resulting archive into sections of 3GB or less. It will work (and was designed for) files larger than 3GB. Windows Defender Live Response currently only supports pulling back files of 3GB or less via the console.

### Run Remote Triage Collections using Magnet Forensics

Using the Live Response console, you can push Magnet RESPONSE ([a free IR data collection tool](https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/getting-started-with-magnet-response/) for members of the forensic community – download the latest version [here](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-response/)) to a Windows endpoint, run a triage collection, and pull that collection back for analysis via the console.

### Run Recursive Collections using Cyber Triage

The Defender Live Response feature can be used to deploy the ([Cyber Triage Collector](https://www.cybertriage.com/cyber-triage-dfir-collector/) to endpoints. The Collector is unique in that it parses and resolves artifacts on the endpoint so that all executable files and documents are collected for in-depth analysis.  Cyber Triage can then analyze and score them to identify malicious activity. 

You can use both the free and paid version of Cyber Triage for this. Results can be saved to file, S3/Azure, or a Cyber Triage server.
